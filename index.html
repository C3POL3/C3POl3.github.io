                A little bit about myself, I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico" target="_blank">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>. 
                I am a full-time college student at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_New_Mexico_Community_College" target="_blank">Central Central New Mexico Community College</a>, 
                attending for an associate's of applied science degree in Computer Information systems, with a concentration in Cybersecurity.
                <br><br>
                As a child, I've always been interested in computers and systems. There was something about them that I found so facinating, how they worked physically with hardware and how the
                Operating System of a computer interacted with software and components within that system. Linux was a huge part of my life growing up. One of my first systems was a broken laptop
                with a missing screen, and I had figured out that you could connect it to a monitor to see viual output. The laptop had an old drive in it, it was an old installation of Windows. 
                I would experiment with the Operating Systems, breaking them, fixing them, then I realized that I could use something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" target="_blank">Virtual Machine</a>. 
                This was a game changer for me.
                <br><br>
                Instead of installing systems on the hardware itself over and over again, I could do it through a hypervisor and keep my original system intact. 
                I have an obession with virtual machines. The first software I used was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox" target="_blank">Oracle VirtualBox</a>. I then moved on to 
                different software and hypervisor, I currently now use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU" target="_blank">QEMU/KVM</a>. My facination with virutal machines has lead me to 
                experimenting on so many systems, either with malware, webservers, DNS Servers, content controllers, malware analysis, pentesting labs, etc. I have fun with virtual machines.
                <br><br>
                I also have some experience with HTML, CSS, PHP and JS, athought it is limited, I would sometimes host local webserver on my network just for fun and update them, even though I knew no one 
                else could see them. It was like a little easter egg for me. I found making these webpages fun, I even created some fun interactive ones (they were usually broken) but some functioned. Now, 
                I would like to improve my skills in HTML, CSS and JS, I think it would be a very good skillset to have and help me take my career further. I understand the basic elements of these web technologies 
                but I would like to understand them more in depth. 
                <br><br>
                Now I have a career to look forward too. I want to be a Red Team Operator, Ethical Hacker, Malware Analyst, Digital Forensisist, etc. There are so many goals I have in my life and so many careers
                I want to pick from. I am one semester away from earning my associate's degree in CIS and I am excited for that. I have 3 certs to my name currently, CompTIA A+, Net+ and Sec+. I hope in the future
                to earn more certs like my CCNA, Pentest+, CySA+, etc. so that I can further my career even more. I hope this course teaches me more about these web technologies so I can understand them more in depth.
